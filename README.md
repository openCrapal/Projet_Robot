# Projet_Robot
Hey!

So my project, yet another robot.. Come on it's fun!
It is actualy a balancing bot, with two coaxial wheels, engines, sensors and stuff 
allowing it to stand in a non-stable position, and to move in my room.

Why?
Well, it is a bit of a challenge, even if there is allready plenty of nice exemples on Youtube.
I'll have to make a smart mecanical design for improved command stability and speed
Programming will be fun too

I gess it is a pretty versatile solution for any kind of "maze runer" bot. In the first time it will stand and explore my room,
then it's gonna recognise the good guys and bring them coffee. Yes you heard me.

Just think about all the possibilities of additionnal functionnalities : mapping, picture processing, AI, calling it Jarvis....

How it will be done?
I have allready build a prototype (October 2015), powered by Arduino (Uno Rev3), able to move in my room 
and to now where it is thanks to impuls count in both wheels BUT NOT TO STAND BY HIMSELF

Next version will include acceleration sensor MPU6050 on an IÂ²C bus

I intend to include a RaspberryPi for wireless communication throught http protocol and wifi.
Best case senario, the RPI will process most of the calculation, allowing multithreading and fancy algorithms
It should also drive a webcam et rund picture processing algorithm for cross-fire localization and stuff

Comments are welcome, it's my first project of that importance.
I'm a mecanical engineering student, I have got an interesting point of view, but just one, that's the point.

openCrapal, the Frensh guy.
